# Map Functionality Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the map functionality implemented for the BIA TaxiGo application.

## Customer Map Page (`/customer/map`)

### Features Implemented:

1. **Location Selection**
   - Customers can select both pickup and dropoff locations using autocomplete
   - Visual markers for pickup (green) and dropoff (red) locations
   - Route highlighting between pickup and dropoff points

2. **Trip Details Display**
   - Distance calculation
   - Estimated duration
   - Cost calculation (50 LKR per KM)
   - Trip information displayed in a bottom sheet

3. **Driver Assignment Logic**
   - Finds the nearest online driver based on pickup location
   - Handles driver rejection and assigns to next nearest driver
   - Simulates driver acceptance/rejection process

4. **Online Drivers Display**
   - Shows all online drivers on the map with blue arrow markers
   - Updates in real-time as drivers come online/offline

5. **Trip Management**
   - Request ride functionality
   - Start trip when driver arrives
   - End trip functionality
   - Payment confirmation

## Driver Map Page (`/driver/map`)

### Features Implemented:

1. **Driver Status Management**
   - Online/offline status tracking
   - Trip status indicators (assigned, pickup, in progress, completed)

2. **Trip Assignment**
   - Receives ride requests from customers
   - Option to accept or reject trips
   - Displays customer information and trip details

3. **Navigation**
   - Route highlighting to pickup location
   - Route highlighting from pickup to destination
   - Real-time directions

4. **Trip Management**
   - Start trip when arriving at pickup location
   - End trip when reaching destination
   - Payment confirmation

## Technical Implementation Details

### Cost Calculation
- Formula: Distance (in KM) Ã— 50 LKR
- Calculated when both pickup and dropoff locations are set
- Displayed in the trip details panel

### Driver Assignment Algorithm
1. Calculate distance from pickup location to each online driver
2. Select the nearest available driver
3. If driver rejects, add to rejected list and find next nearest
4. Continue until a driver accepts or no drivers remain

### Map Libraries Used
- Google Maps JavaScript API
- `@react-google-maps/api` for React integration
- Places library for autocomplete functionality
- Routes library for directions

### Components
- GoogleMap for base map rendering
- Marker for location markers
- DirectionsRenderer for route highlighting
- Custom UI components for trip management

## User Experience

### Customer Flow
1. Select pickup and dropoff locations
2. Review trip details (distance, duration, cost)
3. Request ride
4. Wait for driver assignment
5. Track driver approaching
6. Start trip when driver arrives
7. End trip when destination reached
8. Confirm payment

### Driver Flow
1. Go online to receive ride requests
2. Accept or reject assigned trips
3. Navigate to pickup location
4. Start trip when customer is picked up
5. Navigate to destination
6. End trip when destination reached
7. Confirm payment

## Future Enhancements

1. **Real-time Driver Location Updates**
   - WebSocket integration for live driver positions
   - Enhanced tracking for customers

2. **Advanced Matching Algorithm**
   - Consider driver ratings and preferences
   - Optimize for traffic conditions

3. **Payment Integration**
   - Stripe or other payment gateway integration
   - Digital wallet support

4. **Notifications**
   - Push notifications for trip updates
   - SMS fallback for critical alerts

5. **Multi-stop Trips**
   - Support for multiple destinations
   - Optimized routing for efficiency
