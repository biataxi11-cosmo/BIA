# Google Maps Places API Error Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the "use-places-autocomplete: Google Maps Places API library must be loaded" error.

## Problem

The error occurred because the `use-places-autocomplete` hook requires the Google Maps Places API library to be loaded before it can function properly. The hook was being initialized before the Google Maps script was fully loaded.

## Solution

We implemented a multi-layered approach to ensure proper loading of the Google Maps Places API:

### 1. Custom Google Maps Loading Hook

Created a new hook `useGoogleMaps` in `src/hooks/use-google-maps.ts` that:

- Checks if Google Maps is already loaded
- Dynamically loads the Google Maps script with the Places library if not loaded
- Handles loading errors and timeouts
- Prevents duplicate script loading

### 2. Updated Customer Map Page

Modified `src/app/customer/map/page.tsx` to:

- Use the new `useGoogleMaps` hook to ensure proper loading
- Set the correct `callbackName` parameter for `usePlacesAutocomplete`
- Conditionally initialize `usePlacesAutocomplete` only when Google Maps is loaded
- Remove the incorrect `initOnMount` type usage

### 3. Removed Global Script Loading

Removed the Google Maps script from `src/app/layout.tsx` since we're now handling it locally in the components that need it.

## Key Changes

1. **Added `useGoogleMaps` hook** - A robust solution for loading Google Maps with proper error handling
2. **Fixed `callbackName` parameter** - Set to `'Function.prototype'` as recommended in the documentation
3. **Conditional initialization** - `usePlacesAutocomplete` now only initializes when Google Maps is loaded
4. **Removed global script** - Eliminated potential conflicts by loading Google Maps locally where needed

## Files Modified

1. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Removed global Google Maps script
2. `src/app/customer/map/page.tsx` - Updated to use proper Google Maps loading
3. `src/hooks/use-google-maps.ts` - New hook for robust Google Maps loading

## Testing

The fix has been implemented and should resolve the console error. The autocomplete functionality should now work correctly on the customer map page.

## Future Considerations

1. The driver map page currently doesn't use `usePlacesAutocomplete`, but if it's added in the future, it should follow the same pattern
2. Consider implementing a global state management solution for Google Maps loading if more components require it
3. Monitor for any performance improvements that could be made to the loading process
