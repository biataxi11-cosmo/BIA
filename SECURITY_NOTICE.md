# Security Notice

## Issue
Exposed Google Firebase API Key in public repository:
- Key: AIzaSyCn58l3GXCwRn4byYMs5HyDORFRl10zc3I
- Location: src/lib/firebase.ts and firebase-test.js
- Status: Fixed

## Remediation Steps Taken

1. Removed hardcoded API keys from source code files:
   - src/lib/firebase.ts
   - firebase-test.js

2. Updated configuration to use environment variables only:
   - All Firebase configuration now uses process.env variables
   - Empty string fallbacks instead of actual keys

3. Created proper .env file structure:
   - .env file with placeholder values
   - .env.example file with placeholder values
   - Both files added to .gitignore to prevent accidental commits

4. Verified no exposed keys remain in the codebase:
   - Performed comprehensive search for exposed keys
   - Confirmed all instances have been removed

## Required Actions

1. Rotate the exposed Firebase API key immediately through Firebase Console
2. Generate new API keys for Firebase and Google Maps
3. Update your local .env file with the new keys
4. Revoke the exposed key through Google Cloud Console
5. Check security logs for potential unauthorized usage

## Prevention

To prevent future exposure of secrets:
- Always use environment variables for API keys
- Never commit .env files to version control
- Regularly audit code for exposed secrets
- Use secret scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline
- Implement pre-commit hooks to prevent secret exposure

## Files Updated

- src/lib/firebase.ts
- firebase-test.js
- .env.example
- .env
- .gitignore

## Verification

All exposed keys have been removed from the codebase and replaced with environment variable references.
